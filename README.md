# Discord-Server-Copier
A client that allows the ability for a user to completely copy the entirety of a discord server they choose to copy, into another server. This includes channels, messages and so on.

### Information
Please note the use of this program is against Discord TOS and could result in a ban from discord. To use this you may require an old version of discord.py, aim for one as old as the respository and definitely earlier than version 2.0, this is due to the prevention of the use of self bots and the changing of Discords API. This program is no longer recieving updates and so I have decided to ***archive the respository***.
